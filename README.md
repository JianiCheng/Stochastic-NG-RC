### Stochastic-NG-RC  
This project proposes a novel framework that integrates Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NG-RC) with stochastic control theory, providing a data-driven solution for trajectory tracking in stochastic dynamical systems.  

#### Core Contributions  
- Theoretical Fusion: Combines the predictive power of NG-RC with stochastic control principles to address trajectory tracking challenges in complex, noise-driven systems.  
- Empirical Validation:  
  - Robustness verification on **stochastic Van der Pol systems** under varying noise types (e.g., Gaussian, uniform), intensities, and time scales.  
  - Real-world application: Seizure suppression analysis using **EEG data**, demonstrating practical utility in biomedical signal processing.
